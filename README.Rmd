The {[bro](https://rogiersbart.github.io/bro)} R package collects some functions
I created for myself to facilitate certain tasks. I do not expect it to be very
useful for anyone else, but if you think this can help you out, be my guest!

# Install

You can install the latest version of
{[bro](https://rogiersbart.github.io/bro)} with the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rogiersbart/bro")
```

# Use
